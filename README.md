# Election Smart Contract

This project is a decentralized election system built on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity for the smart contract and React for the frontend. It allows an admin to manage the election process and users to participate in voting. The winner of the election is declared automatically once voting ends.

## Features

- **Admin Panel:**
  - Add candidates to the election.
  - Start the voting process.
  - End the voting process and declare the winner.

- **User Panel:**
  - View the list of candidates.
  - Cast a vote for a candidate.
  - View the election results after voting ends.

## Technology Stack

- **Solidity:** Used for writing the smart contract that manages the election process.
- **React:** Used for building the user interface.
- **Ethereum:** The blockchain platform where the smart contract is deployed.
- **MetaMask:** Used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
